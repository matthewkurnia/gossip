# Gossip

A simple and flexible dialogue system designed to interface with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

## TODO:

Damn, this README is super empty. I need to add the following at some point:
- gossip project structure
- gossip syntax
- how to run gossip
- what it does, and how it integrates with godot
- cool pictures?
